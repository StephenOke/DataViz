# DataViz
The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices of the S&amp;P 500 index using machine learning models, particularly focusing on time series forecasting. We will use historical stock data, analyze trends, and implement models like Facebook Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM to make predictions. 

Team Members and Roles:
Joonbeom Kim:
Role: Data Analyst
Tasks: Dataset sourcing, model implementation, stock market analysis (responsible for sourcing the historical stock data, developing the machine learning models, and overseeing the project's progress).


Stephen Oke:
Role: Data Engineer, Backend Developer
Tasks: Data cleaning, preprocessing, implementing the backend system (responsible for managing the data pipeline and preprocessing it to ensure it is in the correct format for machine learning models).
